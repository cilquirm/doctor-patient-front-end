# DOCFINDER README

Created by: Timothy Quirk and Vincent Chan

Here you will find the front-end for DocFinder, which is a React.js application.

Our project is meant to be a ZocDoc clone. The project uses a Ruby on Rails back-end which can be found [here](https://github.com/tfquirk/DrPatientPortal).

## Setup / Install

After cloning the repository from github, cd into the DocFinder directory:

Install the necessary dependencies with 'npm install' in your terminal.

Make sure your are running your Rails API server on port 8000. You will need to run this command in that directory: 'rails s -p 8000'. If you have do not already have the back-end running, please do so before your 'npm start' your front-end from this directory.

After your back-end is up and running, and after you have run 'npm install', you may run 'npm start' to launch your the React front-end from this directory.
